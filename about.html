    <p>I’m Md. Himel Hossain, a dedicated Software Engineering student at Daffodil International University. Originally from Tangail, I’m currently based in Daffodil Smart City to pursue my academic journey. My passion lies in building impactful digital solutions that bridge real-world needs with innovative technologies. I specialize in frontend web development, focusing on creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces using modern frameworks like React and tools such as Tailwind CSS. Alongside this, I have a solid grounding in programming languages including Python, Java, and C++. I enjoy exploring new trends in tech, collaborating on meaningful projects, and continuously learning to refine my craft as a future software engineer driven by creativity, logic, and user-centric design.</p>
